ReassignOwnership
=================

Omeka plugin to reassign ownership of records.

Allows owners of items and collections, and admins and supers, to change the ownership of items and collections, thus allowing them to create items and collections and then pass off editing rights to others.
The function is available also when batch-editing items.
In items/show and collections/show, admin mode, an extra panel in the sidebar shows the ownership.

As yet mostly untested -- use at your own risk.
